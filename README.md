# Sign up form

This project is a simple sign up form for a web application. This was an easy project to implement because I already had a strong grasp of HTML and CSS, but I'm happy that I completed this project. I learned a little bit about some of the selectors for HTML inputs and more about HTML/JS validation.

## Features

- Form border will render red if input value is invalid and green if user's input is valid.
- Form will toggle messages of invalid information so the user can see clear expectations before submition.
